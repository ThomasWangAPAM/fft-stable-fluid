    "As the computing power grows in the past century, it becomes more viable for computational physicists to perform detailed and precise simulation of matter's interaction with fewer approximation here and there. However, single-particle simulation remains to be one of the most formidable barrier since the amount of resources required can be hardly found in common places outside of supercomputer sites and national laboratories. Even for the case of collisionless and incompressible fluid-flow motion of identical particles--a relatively simple physical interaction between matters--this problem still exists, provoking scientists to look for simplifications in modeling that permits acceptable accuracy and time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at the simplified models proposed by many researchers, it's noticeable that most of them treat such a particle flow as a continuous medium rather than discrete particles. Thus, the **Navier-Stokes** equations, a physical relation for viscous fluid derived from physics laws like momentum balance of Newtonian fluids and conservation of mass, become an ideal description of fluid in Computational Fluid Dynamics:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $u$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure field, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $\\rho$ is the fluid's density, and $f$ is an external force. Nevertheless, it's not so simple to solve the Navier-Stokes equations: there are many numerical schemes with different level of accuracy and stability that solve equation, and understanding what our solution will be used for is essential for making the appropriate decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "For us, the accuracy of physical quantities of the fluid is not of our primary concern; enthusiastic about realistic animation of matter flows, we are more interested in the intricate shape and movement of the particles forming a viscous fluid--the same goal as Jos Stam, who was a researcher at a 3D graphics software company called Alias|wavefront in 1999. In his famous paper titled [*Stable Fluids*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/311535.311548), he proposed an unconditionally stable solver of Navier-Stokes equations where stability is not influenced by the length of time step. His numerical scheme is also known for its relative simplicity in interpretation and implementation, so we chose to reproduce his solver in 2D space and by enforcing periodic boundary conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we assume periodic boundary conditions is that, when solving the Navier-Stokes equations, we can represent the functions as linear combinations of sinusoidal waves. We can then use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to significantly reduce implementation difficulty as many linear operations like the gradient or the Laplacian that are used in Stam's solver become diagonal operators in the Fourier domain. Instead of carrying out complicated computations in the spatial domain, we can transform to the Fourier domain, perform the much easier computations, and transform back. Details on the solver and why FFT is an elegant way to implement the solver are provided in the **Computational Methods** part below. Apart from making our calculations easier, FFT is a cornerstone of modern computational mathematics and engineering, enabling efficient analysis of data across numerous fields such as signal processing, medical imaging, physics simulations, financial modeling, and machine learning. Therefore, we thought understanding and implementing the FFT algorithm itself would be an interesting and meaningful process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for the final project, We will implement from scratch the solver and the accompanying Fast Fourier Transform package, and we will visualize the results as a flow of viscous fluid and its constituent particles. For simplicity, we will not implement the evolution of other scalar quantity moving with the fluid and the real-time user interaction. Instead, when running the solver, we will impose an initial force that applies to the evolution for only at its start (e.g., the first second), after which the fluid is left to evolve by itself."

    "The problem of visualizing matter flow without resorting to the single-particle simulation is common among visual effect designers looking for animation of intricate turbulences of fluids like smoke and cloud. They are not into the physics of the fluids, so trading physical accuracy for better time complexity and more detailed fluid motion works the best for them. Jos Stam's method also permits long time steps, making efficient simulation of long-term movement of fluids possible for animators. For us, this satisfies our curiosity in the creation of visual effect for fluids because we were fascinated by simulation animation of fluids in the context of race car aerodynamics, and we are excited to implement this and generate our own fluid flow."

    "Upon reviewing our simulations, we believe that our project successfully achieved its goals, which is to deliver a stable and visually correct simulation of fluid dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The custom-implemented Fourier Transform functions were rigorously tested against `numpy`'s native functions using `numpy.testing.assert_allclose`, confirming their numerical correctness. Moreover, by carefully following the methodology outlined in Jos Stam's paper, we ensured that our solver maintained the unconditional stability characteristic of Stam's approach with arbitrary time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "We think our implementations of the FFT are also effective and successful in terms of their performance. For input size of 256, our `fft` and `ifft` are 60 to 70 times faster than our own `dft` and `idft` functions. Compared to `numpy`'s highly optimized functions, our implementations are 12 - 13 times slower. Given that `numpy.fft` are implemented in C language, I think our implementation in Python is already decent. For our `fft2` and `ifft2`, our implementation is only 7 - 8 times slower. More importantly, when substituting our `fft2` and `ifft2` into the solver, we did not observe any noticeable slowdown or lag. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the simulation animations, we think the fluid part also worked. The plots depicting fluid flows exhibit the behaviors we anticipated, providing visually intuitive and sensible outcomes. We also tested different initial conditions for the forces applied, and the results were consistent with our expectations, which further validates the effectiveness of the solver on a computer graphics level. However, it is indeed hard to judge how accurate the result is because, as mentioned above and in Jos Stam's paper, this unconditionally stable solver trade accuracy for stability and efficiency. It is not adequate and should not be used for precise engineering and physics endeavors. Yet, on a visual demonstration level, we think it was able to does its job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, there are several directions for further development. One involves enhancing the FFT implementation. Currently, our solver relies on the original Cooley-Tukey algorithm, which restricts length of input to powers of two. Incorporating advanced algorithms that leverage prime factorization and different twiddle factors would enable support for arbitrary grid sizes. On the fluid solver side, an interesting next step would be to introduce rigid bodies into the simulation space, which will let us visualize fluid-object interactions, such as the aerodynamics of vehicles. Although this was mentioned initially in the project proposal, time constraints prevented us from implementing it here. Such an addition would also require modifications to the solver to accommodate for non-periodic boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we think the project not only met its objectives but also gave us a good framework for future improvements in more versatile simulations. We'd love to continue with the implementations on our own. Thank you, Professor Spiegelman, for reading!"
